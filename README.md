# COMP1038 coursework 2: Food Order Management System.

---

This code is my coursework for University of Nottingham Ningbo COMP1038 (Programming and Algorithms) when I was
an exchange student studying in PRC. 

Some students were curious about how did I implement this coursework -- which motivates me to free this code.
The requirement of this coursework is to implement a Food Order Management System using C programing language
(C99 standard with VLA, POSIX environment), which users could select 
and order food in pre-recorded categories, and program could read and modify csv sheets which stores the
food menu and transition history. The program should be able to modify categories and food items, view transition
history in a password protected Admin session.

I implemented few basic data structures:

- optimized single link list to store the categories and items. 
- Unicode string (mutable) extended from link list with basic methods.
- Key-Value pair Hash table
- Table structure which could search sub-sheets or columns using key or index.
- A tiny runtime to perform dynamic type-check for values in .csv file
- A .csv file parser and reader, which allows storing different sheets in a single .csv file or read a sheet
which locates in multiple .csv files.

___COMP1038 Is an intro course for CS students, so this code should be very easy to understand.___

## compile:
In University of Nottingham Ningbo, courseworks are evaluated on an CentOS 7 server running GCC 9.x. 
The program should compile with no warnings and errors with following params:

    gcc -std=c99 -lm â€“Wall -g -fsanitize=leak FoodOrderMgntSystem.c -o FoodOrderMgntSystem

for this work, as long as a GNU/Linux environment is used, you could compile either using GCC or Clang, 
with or without optimization. For example:

    gcc -O3 FoodOrderMgntSystem.c
    ./a.out
